       Raspberry Pi Python Motion Capture and goggle drive syncing using grive
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
Security camera application using a Raspberry PI computer with a RPI camera module. Detects motion then names (number sequence or sequential) and saves images.
Optionally synchronizes images with your google drive using a precompiled (github) grive binary (requires security setup).

Important
---------
Note if you are using Picamera python module and images are black or have problems then update Raspberry PI firmware per command below
from ssh login or terminal execute the following command to upgrade to latest firmware.  This should resolve any picamera issues.

sudo rpi-upgrade
          
Upgrade History
---------------
22-Sep-2014 - Version 2.1 of pymotion.py with an option to use the picamera python module to take large photo rather than raspistill
New Features
- Changed setup.sh so it installs python-imaging and python-picamera by default. Note grive_setup.sh has been replaced
- Added option to use picamera to take large photo instead of shelling out to raspian to run raspistill
  Note small image still uses raspistill. 
- Added lowLight picamera option to take low light photos during specified hours.  This dramatically improves
  low light photos but don't use during bright light conditions or photos will be washed out
- Added bestPhoto option to make Daylight photo more consistent
- Added makemovie.py to create a avi movie from contents of google_drive folder.
Fixes
- Fixed bug that crashes pimotion if numsequence is set to False caused by displaying initial settings information

Background
----------
I have been working on a grive capable security camera using two types of security camera cases.  
One is a small fake plastic security cam case from Amazon.  Model A or B fits inside with wifi only.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D8NZ52/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Here is a larger aluminum camera case that I have a model B installed in.  This one has room for a usb power supply etc..
http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-108431-Outdoor-Camera-Switchable/dp/B007VDTTTM/ref=sr_1_72?ie=UTF8&qid=1393884556&sr=8-72&keywords=fake+security+camera
I may do a youtube video on How To setup these cases with the raspberry pi computer and camera module installed.

After some work I now have the Raspberry Pi security camera's working efficiently from a software point of view.  
The current configuration uses a modified version of pimotion.py script to save files to a number sequence instead of a date-time sequence. 
I also added some code (not mine) to optionally put date/time information directly on the photo images.  
This is convenient to see the exact time stamp that the photo was taken. 
Using number sequencing allows limiting the number of files that need to get synchronized to my google drive. 
It was too much to manage all the dated files and cleanup in google drive.  
This method restricts the number of motion files that need to get updated via grive. Files are overwritten in Round robin fashion.
If you need more history you can write a routine to save google drive files from a synchronized PC folder to a dated archive folder
using a windows robocopy freefilesync or similar program through a batch file.  Synchronization uses a rpi compiled version of grive.  
This requires slightly modifying the source code to make it compatible with the RPI.
  
The tar file is a complete setup including a precompiled grive to reduce the effort required to get this working.  
To automate the security camera operation, I have setup pimotion.py to run from a /etc/init.d/pimotion.sh bash script
by copying skeleton file to pimotion.sh script (sample included).  Then modified to run your pimotion.py script on boot.
see later in post for more setup detail.

You must have a raspberry pi model A, B or B+ with the latest raspbian build and pi camera module installed and working.  
There are several tutorials showing how to do this so it is not covered here. 
This assumes you know how to cut and paste into nano or similar text editor on the pi using ssh. 
You also need an operational internet connection via wifi or wired connection.  
Wifi needs to be setup to work on boot with no desktop in order for the camera to sync unattended with your google drive.  
I have written the pimotion python script and bash sync scripts to make it somewhat independent of the folder names etc.  
This minimizes hard coding folder names in the scripts.  
If you run the script manually from the command line then settings and activity information will be displayed.
Just a little setup for pimotion.py  If you already have a pimotion.py then mv existing file to another file name

Download and Setup Instructions
-------------------------------
Use putty to ssh into an internet connected raspberry pi and execute the following commands.  
Note change picam to a folder name of your choice if required.

cd ~
mkdir picam
cd ./picam
# Download pimotion.tar file from my github account from a logged in ssh or terminal session on your raspberry pi.
wget https://raw.github.com/pageauc/pi-motion-grive/master/pimotion.tar
# Extract tar files to current folder
tar -xvf pimotion.tar
# Install required grive libraries from the internet
sudo ./setup.sh 
# Note this will take a while so be patient

Change pimotion.py settings as required
---------------------------------------
pimotion.py is the modified pimotion.py script based on previous modified brainflakes script.  
I modified the script to allow the use of a number sequence to restrict the total number of files
that need to get sync'd to my google drive using grive.  Currently set to 500 images 
Please note this includes PIL imageFont and imageDraw python modules to optionally put a date-time stamp on each photo.
Make sure you are in the correct folder containing pimotion.py

nano pimotion.py

Use nano editor to modify any pimotion.py script settings as required eg Threshold, Sensitivity, image prefix, numbering range, etc.  
See code comments for details.
I have the pimotion.py camera image settings set to flipped due to the camera module mounting position in the fake security camera case.
You may also want to change sensitivity and/or threshold as needed as well as the filename prefix etc.  Ctrl-X to save and exit nano editor.

Details if you wish to compile grive yourself (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------------
You will need to download the tar file from the web link below and extract it on your raspberry pi or compile a modified version of grive in order to sync files to your google drive
see instructions from url link below.  Compiling takes a little while and you must edit the specified /home/pi/grive/libgrive/src/drive/State.cc file per the web link below.  If you have problems read the posts.  When you initialize grive with google I opened an ssh session to the raspberry pi on my windows 7 PC and then cut and pasted the grive -a url to chrome browser while logged into google.  This takes you to a screen that returns a very long security code.  I then cut and pasted this into the RPI session and everything worked just fine.  I did not login to google on the pi.  I only needed the PC to be logged in and paste the authentication code back to the pi from the PC.  I don't think you need a logged in google account on the pi as the post mentions.  At any rate it worked for me and I had to try several times since I was trying to avoid having grive executable in the google_drive folder.  By using the -p option and copying the grive hidden config files to the rpi google_drive folder I managed to get everything to work.

or this link might be even better
http://www.pihomeserver.fr/en/2013/08/15/raspberry-pi-home-server-synchroniser-le-raspberry-pi-avec-votre-google-drive/

Once compile is successful copy the grive executable to the folder that pimotion.py and sync.sh are located

Optional Setup grive security to your google account
----------------------------------------------------
If you want to synchronize image files to your google drive then follow the instructions below
Note you must have a valid google account and google drive.
On a PC open a web browser eg chrome and login to your google account and check that you have a google drive.
Important
---------
It is recommended that any documents you have be moved to a separate google drive folder eg my_files.  This will prevent
these files from getting sync'd back to the Raspberry PI.
You can also perform this operation from a RPI desktop terminal and web browser if you like.  Just make sure you are logged into google.
from ssh session or RPI desktop terminal session

cd ~
cd picam    # or name of folder you chose
sudo ./grive -a

This will display a web browser url.
You will need to highlight the displayed url on the RPI and paste into the PC or RPI web browser URL bar. 
Note if you are using putty ssh then right click to paste RPI highlighted url into the PC's web browser url bar 
The url will open a new web page and display a security hash token.  Copy and paste this security token into grive via ssh session on rpi. 
if grive -a session hit enter to accept security token. grive will indicate if the operation was successful

If you previously ran pimotion.py then a google_drive folder should already be created under the picam folder (or whatever folder you picked)
If it does not exist run 

./pimotion.py

to create google_drive or manually create using mkdir command if desired.

Once grive has been initialized successfully with the grive -a option then
copy the /home/pi/.grive and /home/pi/.grive_state files to the /home/pi/google_drive folder per above code. 
This will allow grive to be executed from the /home/pi folder so it does not have to be in the google_drive folder.

sudo cp ./.grive google_drive
sudo cp ./.grive_state google_drive
sudo ./sync.sh

You should see grive handshake with your google account and synchronize files both ways between google and the RPI

Test pimotion.py and sync.sh together
-------------------------------------
To test you can launch pimotion.py from one ssh session and sync.sh from a second ssh terminal session. 
Note: This can also be done from the RPI desktop using two terminal sessions.

First terminal session
----------------------
cd ~
cd picam  # or whatever folder name you used.
sudo ./pimotion.py

Second terminal session
-----------------------
From a second ssh terminal run sync.sh (make sure that motion was detected and files are in the google_drive folder to sync).  
You should see a /home/pi/sync.lock file.  This is created by pimotion.py when motion photos were created.

cd ~
cd picam  # or whatever folder name you used.
sudo ./sync.sh

You should see files being synchronized in both directions.  This is normal.  
There are google drive apps for Apple, Android, Mac and PC.  Just do a search for google drive in the appropriate app/play store 
This will allow you to access your google drive on the web to view the raspberry pi motion capture security camera images
You can also download and install the google drive windows application to your PC.
Make sure you have a wifi or wired network connection to the internet that will start when the RPI boots headless.
see setup for crontab and init.d setup for further details
pymotion.py should start automatically and save images to the google_drive folder.  When the crontab is executed it will
initiate a sync of images to your google drive on the web.  
 
Note:
-----
I also setup a cronjob to reboot the rpi once a day but this may not be necessary for you.  
I did it since I intend to leave the rpi security camera run remotely and this gives a chance for system to recover should there be a glitch.
Also if you have problems check permissions.  The init.d will run as root so the files in the google_drive folder will be owned by root.  
Just check to make sure you run with sudo ./pimotion.sh and sudo ./sync.sh if you are in terminal sessions.
Once you know sync.sh is working OK you can automate the sync by running it in as a cronjob.

Setup init.d script to auto launch pimotion.py on boot-up of raspberry pi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note there is a copy of the init.d pimotion.sh in the tar file so you should be able to copy if instead of the skeleton file method
below if you wish  eg in the pimotion folder execute the following then skip to step 4
sudo cp pimotion.sh /etc/init.d
check permissions for the /etc/init.d/pimotion.sh to make sure it is executable  
ls -al /etc/init.d/pimotion.sh

cd /etc/init.d
if required change permissions for pimotion.sh
chmod +x pimotion.sh
sudo nano pimotion.sh   # change appropriate entries to point to your pimotion.py script and save the file ctrl-x
sudo update-rc.d /etc/init.d/pimotion.sh defaults
cd ~

Optional  (Only if you have setup grive security)
Create a crontab to automate syncronization to google_drive from the RPI
------------------------------------------------------------------------
From an logged in ssh or terminal session

sudo crontab -e

Paste the following line into the crontab file nano editor and modify folder name and frequency if required.
currently executes every minute. 

*/1 * * * * /home/pi/picam/sync.sh >/dev/nul

ctrl-x to exit nano and save crontab file
This cron job will run once a minute.  You can change to suit your needs.  
If grive is already running or there are no files to process then the script simply exits. 
Also if grive has been running for more than 5 minutes it is killed.  
This can be changed in the script if you wish.

Reboot RPI and test operation by triggering motion and checking images are successfully transmitted to your google_drive
and optionally sync'd with your google drive on the internet.  
Trouble shoot problems as required.

Good Luck
